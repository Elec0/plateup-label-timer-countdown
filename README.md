# Label Timer Countdowns

Ever been frustrated that the customer countdowns were inexact? Me too, so I made this mod.

## Usage
The plugin automatically loads when you start the game, and it automatically updates with new timers as customers come in.

The window is draggable, and clicking the little button in the top left will minimize it.

### In Multiplayer
Currently this *kind of* works in multiplayer.  
Only the **host** will see the correct values. All other players will see nonsense numbers.
